<h2>Pro Runner</h2>
 <h5>This is an infinity runner game where the block needs to be escaped from the upcoming holes and other obstacles by moving our block up and down by pressing SpaceBar.</h5>
 <br>
1.As the points increase, make the runner move faster and faster.
 <br>
2.Use a vertically asymmetric runner (example: a triangle). When the gravity is switched, flip the player upside down as well.
 <br>
3.Generate different shaped obstacles that move up and down on the screen. The game must end if the runner touches the obstacle.
 <br>
4.Generate power ups on the map that activate abilities for sometime (example: slows down the game, grants invincibility, etc.)
